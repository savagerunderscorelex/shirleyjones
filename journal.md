## 11/1: Created Project

2:21 PM Created clue class + NPC class + player class

2:38 PM Edited classes to be static, initialized player, clues, and clues list

## 11/4 Testing out some functions

5:15 PM I edited the function for creating a scanner for input to where the player will choose to go. I'm putting all input functions in a input function class that has functions/methods that will be called every time that there needs to be input.

5:27 PM update README

## 11/5 Figuring out how to use conditional statements for input

6:27 PM For the last 30 minutes I've been trying to figure out how to compare strings. I first did it like I would have done in Python:
`if (string1 == "hellostring"){
    do this
}`

However, no matter how many times I tested the function it wouldn't do it. The issue was that I didn't realize that comparing strings in Java is different than comparing strings in Python, Javascript, or GDScript (my only experiences in languages so far). So I had to use the equals method to compare strings (which I found out through a google search).

## 11/7

For the last 2 days I focused more on developing characters instead of actually programming. I plan to write dialogues on Milanote first and then try to incorporate them in the dialogue class functions.
